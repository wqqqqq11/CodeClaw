FILE_IO_RULES = """## File Operations (CRITICAL)
When creating NEW files (HTML, Python, CSS, Java, etc.):
- ALWAYS use this EXACT format: ```python:filename.py
- Put the filename AFTER the language with a colon: ```lang:filename.ext
- Examples: ```html:landing.html, ```python:script.py, ```css:style.css
- The file will be saved to the runtime workspace directory
- DO NOT include explanatory text inside code blocks - only the actual code
- If the output is large code, ALWAYS save to files and keep chat reply short.
- Never dump full source code in chat when files are created.

When editing EXISTING files:
- ALWAYS use this EXACT format:
```edit:path/to/file.ext
<<<<<<< SEARCH
exact old text from the file
=======
new text
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
- SEARCH text must match the file exactly.
- SEARCH text must be unique (only one match).
- You may include multiple SEARCH/REPLACE hunks in one edit block.
- Keep file paths relative to the runtime workspace root.
- After edits, provide only a short summary (not full diff body)."""
